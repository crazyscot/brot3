# brot3

An interactive fractal explorer.

This is my third Mandelbrotter.
[`brot2`](https://github.com/crazyscot/brot2) was the previous incarnation, an interactive GTK+ application.
The original `brot` was written in C, output only to the terminal, and has long since been lost to the mists of time.

This time around it's in Rust and has quite the history.

- brot3 1.0 started out using Tauri and OpenSeadragon for its UI.
- Version 2.0 (never released) was an attempt to rework the GUI using slint.
- The 3.0 branch is a significant overhaul, rendering on the GPU using [rust-gpu](https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-gpu), with GUI using [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui).

More notes to come here when things are in less of a state of flux...

## Supported systems

Primary:

- Debian (I develop on 13/trixie; releases are built on Ubuntu 22.04)

Secondary:

- OSX (minimum Rust supported versions apply; currently 10.12 on x86_64 and 11.0 on aarch64)
- Windows 11

Binary releases can be found in [github releases](https://github.com/crazyscot/brot3/releases/).

## Experimenting

### Prerequisites

You only really need a recent version of the `cargo` tool.

We use a [toolchain file](rust-toolchain.toml) to select the rust-gpu recommended toolchain, which is currently a specific nightly build that you're unlikely to have to hand. This is required as rust-gpu makes significant use of compiler internals.

### Building

**Cargo will automatically install the required nightly toolchain if you don't already have it.**

`cargo run --locked` will launch the GUI in interactive mode. By default this runs with the `hot-reload-shader` feature. As you might imagine, this rebuilds and reloads the shader on save.

For a standalone application binary, `cargo build --locked --no-default-features` disables runtime shader compilation.

There are limited unit tests and benchmarks. More may be added later.

### Speeding up build times

You may care to use an alternative linker to improve build times.

For example, if you want to use the [wild linker](https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild) (`cargo binstall wild-linker`) this is what you might put in your `~/.cargo/config.toml`:

```
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "clang"
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=--ld-path=wild"]
```
